## Strategy Overview

- Fundamental investing systems rely on analyzing the fundamental factors of securities, such as financial statements, economic indicators, industry trends, and company-specific information.
- The goal is to assess the true value of an asset and make investment decisions based on its potential for long-term growth.

## Fundamental Analysis

- Fundamental investing systems extensively employ fundamental analysis to evaluate the value and prospects of securities.
- This analysis involves examining various factors, including

  - Financial Statements
    - Traders analyze company financial statements, including balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements, to assess the financial health, profitability, and cash flow generation of the company.

  - Economic Indicators
    - Traders monitor macroeconomic indicators, such as GDP growth rates, inflation, interest rates, and employment data, to understand the overall economic environment and its impact on various sectors and industries.

  - Industry Analysis
    - Traders assess the dynamics, trends, and competitive landscape of specific industries to identify potential investment opportunities and risks.

  - Company-Specific Information
    - Traders analyze company-specific information, such as management quality, competitive advantages, product pipeline, and market positioning, to evaluate the company's growth potential and future prospects.

## Valuation Techniques

- Fundamental investing systems employ various valuation techniques to determine the fair value of securities
- Common valuation methods include

  - Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
    - This ratio compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share (EPS) and provides insights into the stock's relative valuation.

  - Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio
    - The P/B ratio compares a company's market price to its book value per share, which represents the net asset value of the company.

  - Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
    - DCF analysis estimates the intrinsic value of a security by discounting the expected future cash flows of the investment to their present value.

  - Comparable Company Analysis
    - Traders compare a company's valuation metrics, such as P/E ratio or P/B ratio, to those of similar companies in the industry to determine relative value.

## Trade Entry and Exit

- Fundamental investing systems consider factors such as asset valuation, growth prospects, and market conditions to determine entry and exit points.
- Traders aim to buy assets when they are undervalued and have strong growth potential, and sell or reduce holdings when assets become overvalued or their prospects change.

## Risk Management

- Risk management is an integral part of fundamental investing systems to protect against potential losses and manage portfolio risk.
- Traders employ techniques such as diversification, position sizing, and stop-loss orders to limit downside risk and control exposure to individual assets or sectors.
