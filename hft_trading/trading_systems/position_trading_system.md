# Position Trading System

- Positional trading is a trading strategy that involves taking positions in securities or assets for longer durations, typically ranging from days to months or even years.
- It focuses on capturing the overall trend or direction of the market and profiting from significant price movements over time.
- In positional trading systems, the focus is on capturing larger price movements driven by fundamental factors and sustained trends.
- Traders aim to benefit from the overall direction of the market and hold positions for extended periods to maximize profit potential.

## Here's a detailed explanation of positional trading systems
### Strategy Overview

- Positional trading systems aim to identify and capitalize on longer-term market trends.
- Instead of frequent trading or short-term fluctuations, these systems seek to capture substantial price movements driven by fundamental factors or significant market developments.

### Time Horizon

- Positional traders hold their positions for an extended period, ranging from several days to several months or even longer.
- This time frame allows them to ride out short-term volatility and profit from sustained price trends.

### Fundamental Analysis

- Positional trading often involves extensive fundamental analysis of the assets being traded.
- Traders focus on analyzing various factors such as financial statements, economic indicators, industry trends, company news, and macroeconomic factors to identify potential investment opportunities.

### Trend Identification

- Positional traders aim to identify and trade in the direction of major market trends.
- They use technical analysis tools, such as trend lines, moving averages, or chart patterns, to determine the prevailing trend.
- By aligning their trades with the dominant trend, positional traders seek to benefit from larger price moves.

### Trade Entry and Exit

- Positional trading systems typically employ less frequent trade entries and exits compared to shorter-term trading strategies.
- Traders often wait for confirmation of the trend and look for opportune entry points to initiate a position.
- They may use a combination of technical indicators, price patterns, or fundamental factors to time their entries and exits.

### Risk Management

- Risk management is crucial in positional trading systems to protect against adverse market moves over the longer holding period.
- Positional traders employ techniques such as setting stop-loss orders, trailing stops, or employing proper position sizing to manage risk and protect capital.

## Example of Positional Trading

- Let's consider an example of a positional trading system focused on the stock market
  1. Strategy
      - The trader uses a fundamental approach, analyzing company financials, news, and industry trends to identify undervalued stocks with strong growth potential.
  2. Trend Identification
      - The trader identifies a stock that shows a bullish long-term trend based on technical analysis, such as higher highs and higher lows, and a strong fundamental outlook for the company.
  3. Trade Entry
      - The trader waits for a favorable entry point, such as a retracement or consolidation within the broader uptrend. Once the stock price reaches the identified entry level, a position is initiated.
  4. Trade Management
      - The trader monitors the position, keeping track of key developments, news, and any changes in the fundamental outlook of the company.
      - They may adjust stop-loss orders or trailing stops to manage risk and protect profits.
  5. Trade Exit
      - The trader maintains the position until the stock price reaches a predetermined target based on their analysis of the stock's potential upside.
      - They may also exit the trade if there is a significant negative change in the fundamental outlook or if the stock's price reaches a predetermined stop-loss level.
  6. Risk Management
      - The trader ensures proper risk management by setting a predetermined maximum percentage of capital to risk per trade and adjusting position size accordingly.
      - They also monitor portfolio risk and diversification to avoid overexposure to a single stock or sector.
